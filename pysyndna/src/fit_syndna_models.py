    """Fits per-sample linear regression models predicting mass from counts.

    This function fits a linear regression model for each sample,
    predicting log10(mass of instances of a sequence) within a sample
    from log10(read counts for that sequence) within the sample,
    using spike-in data from synDNAs.

    Note that this function originally followed the R notebooks for Zaramela
    et al. and fit the log10 of the mass of the syndna in the sample to the
    log10 of the counts per million of the read for that syndna in the sample.
    However, later work by Oriane Moyne left out the CPMs and demonstrated
    that one can achieve the same end result (of OGU mass predictions) by
    fitting the log10 mass of the syndna in the sample to log10 of the read
    counts themselves.  (The slope of the fits are the same in both cases,
    while the intercepts differ by a constant factor because the CPM
    calculation modifies the read count by a constant factor--dividing by
    total reads in the sample and multiplying by a million.)  When one uses
    the resulting fits on the raw read counts for OGUs, one gets the same
    mass predictions as when using the fits on the CPMs on the CPMs for the
    OGUs. (HOWEVER, since I know it will come up: note that this is not true if
    one looks at the mass predictions from the original Zaramela R notebooks,
    which unintentionally used a different total counts value for the CPM
    calculation in the fit than they used for the CPM calculation in the
    OGU mass prediction, leading to inconsistent results.)
